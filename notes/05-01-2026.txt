useRef
This is an important React function cause it allows to interact beetween different components of the UI
without the need of rendering components

 const inputFocus = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const FocusInput = () => {
    inputFocus.current?.focus();
  };

<button onClick={FocusInput}>
<VscSearch className={Styles.MagnifierIcon} />
</button>
<input ref={inputFocus} type="text" placeholder="Look for a song" />

In this case i used to focus on the input once the user clicks on the button, it is important to keep in
mind use <HTMLInputElement> cause we're using TS and the symbol ? which avoids the app to crash.
