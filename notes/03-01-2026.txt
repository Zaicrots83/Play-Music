1. Today i learned about the propety :focus, this is used when an input, a select or something 
similar is activated, i also learned about the properti outline, this is the border that appears when you
select an element like an input or a select.

.searchBar input:focus{
    outline: none;
}

2. Label, this is important to link elements in this case i use it to connect the icon of a magnifier with
the input of the searchbar

<label title="Search">🔎︎<input type="text" placeholder="What do you want to listen to?"></input></label>

3. "THIS IS IMPORTANT" theres another class called focus-within this means that it will apply effects to a
pather container when one of the child components is activated, for example:

<div className = {Styles.searchBar}>
    <label title="Search">🔎︎<input type="text" placeholder="What do you want to listen to?"></input></label>
    <button title="Clear">✖</button>
</div>

.searchBar:focus-within{
    outline: auto;
}

in this case when the input is activated it will apply the border to all the div, not just the input

4. I also learned about the attribute title in html, it is used to show a message when the user hover over
an item:

<button title="This is a message">This is just an example</button>

5. REALLY IMPORTANT setState
this is used to manage the value of the elements, this is important to elements like textfields, inputs,
etc.
-First thing you have to do is import it: import { useState } from "react";
-after that you'll have to define the initial value and the current value, you do this using a const:
const [initialValue, currentValue] = useState("");
-after that you have to declare the function in this case im using it to get the value of an input
 
 function searchBarValue(e:React.ChangeEvent <HTMLInputElement>) {
    currentValue(e.target.value);
  }

"important details": in this case im using ts so this doesnt recognize e/event so you have to clarify
whats e, e is basically and event that's taking place in the website, for example someone writing inside
an input, that's why you have to specify that this is a type of react: React.ChangeEvent, in this case im
using it for an input, that's why i used <HTMLInputElement> but it will depend on what kind of element you
are using.

it is important to put the value in the input it means, put this value={initialValue} and of course the 
function onChange={searchBarValue}

-I created a button to erase the content of the input once the user click in there so to that i had to 
put a function inside the button to change the state
<button title="Clear" onClick={()=>currentValue("")}>✖</button>

-To put JS inside a jsx you have to use this {}, using this React will understand that what's inside is
JS, you can't use commands like if, you use something different

{
    initialValue && (
                <button title="Clear" onClick={()=>currentValue("")}>✖</button>
            )
}

it looks strange but basically means if initialValue is true it means is different of false or "" or 0 or
null render the button x
